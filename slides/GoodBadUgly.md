## Gnews - The Good, The Bad and The Ugly

### IME ... this looks like a job for ... Google? ... or Purism?
- ME is actually running its own entire MINIX OS... Due to its presence on every Intel system, the Unix-like OS is the most widely deployed OS in the world
- Google is working on removing it
- Purism Now Offers Laptops with Intel's 'Management Engine' Disabled
- because it runs coreboot and maintains its own BIOS firmware update process, it has been able to release coreboot that disables the Management Engine from running
- directly halting the ME CPU without the ability of recovery
- Disabling the Management Engine, long believed to be impossible, is now possible in all current Librem laptops (or as a software update for existing machines)
