# Skill Levels

<hr />

- Experienced
- Novice / None
- Domain specific (science/gov/...)
- Any and All

Note:
Will we target a particular skill level or area of interest like science?

Trying to cater to everyone could be difficult

The more targeted we are the more we can prepare

# Mentoring

<hr />

- Ad-hoc vs tiered
- Volunteer vs prescribed

Note:
Do we want to pre arrange mentors or just rely on whoever turns up?

Do we want to structure the mentors into levels or types or more ad-hoc? (Greet, Q&A, L1, L2)

---

# Grouping(s)

<hr />

- Individual
- Small groups
- Mob / All in

Note:
Do we want to help one-on-one or run it more like a workshop or class?

Maybe rather than specifying size we want to aim for a ratio of mentors to guests?
