##### Software Freedom Day?
- Thoughts?
- Comments?
- Volunteers?

Note:
Also LUV are having a Debian Launch Party on the 17th this Saturday so there might be an installfest happening there

FSS are running a workshop too, on VMs with a privacy focus

So would this be something we could consider for SFD?
