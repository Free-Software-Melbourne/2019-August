Intros and Talks

Do we want prepared talks on particular beginner issues?

Would these be better as workshops or demos?

# Demos and Workshops

- Install
- Default Applications
- Post-Install Applications

Note:
Demos and Workshops

Will we just be installing Linux and saying "job done" or will we have planned activities to do with your new Linux box?

What kinds of software do we want to suggest next?

# Apps & Themes

<hr />

- General
- High level (security / games)
- Low level (photo editing / hello world / ...)
- ...

Note:
Apps & Themes

Would we theme the event to a general concept, a particular app or even a specific exercise?

Games could be fun, but privacy or secure comms could be popular

Science or photo editing could be popular and different too

Linux only server based software like OpenRefine
