### DuckDuckGo CEO: 'Google and Facebook Are Watching Our Every Move Online. It's Time To Make Them Stop'
- What you may not realize, though, is 76 percent of websites now contain hidden Google trackers, and 24 percent have hidden Facebook trackers
- Congress and federal agencies need to take a fresh look at what can be done to curb these data monopolies. They first need to demand more algorithmic and privacy policy transparency, so people can truly understand the extent
- Only then can informed consent be possible
- need to legislate that people own their own data, enabling real opt-outs
- restrict how data can be combined including being more aggressive at blocking acquisitions that further consolidate data

### 'How I Coined the Term Open Source'
- there are a number of accounts of the coining of the term, for example by Eric Raymond and Richard Stallman, yet this is mine, written on January 2, 2006. It has never been published, until today. The introduction of the term "open source software" was a deliberate effort to make this field of endeavor more understandable to newcomers and to business, which was viewed as necessary to its spread to a broader community of users
- those new to the term "free software" assume it is referring to the price. Oldtimers must then launch into an explanation
- While not ideal, it struck me as good enough. I ran it by at least four others: Eric Drexler, Mark Miller, and Todd Anderson liked it, while a friend in marketing and public relations felt the term "open" had been overused and abused and believed we could do better
- Maddog mentioned "freely distributable" as an earlier term, and "cooperatively developed" as a newer term. Eric listed "free software," "open source," and "sourceware"

- Barlow knew that new technology could create and empower evil as much as it could create and empower good. He made a conscious decision to focus on the latter
- hoping to give Liberty a running start before the laws of Moore and Metcalfe delivered up what Ed Snowden now correctly calls 'turn-key totalitarianism.'"

### Yale Privacy Lab has collaborated with Exodus Privacy to detect and expose trackers with the help of the F-Droid app store

Installing F-Droid isn't a silver bullet, but it's the first step in protecting yourself from malware

- FCC Report Claims Broken Broadband Market Has Been Fixed By Killing Net Neutrality
- falsely claiming that the agency's attack on net neutrality is already paying huge dividends when it comes to sector investment and competition
- data the agency is relying on to "prove" this claim comes from before current FCC boss Ajit Pai even took office
- FCC has repeatedly tried to claim that the FCC's 2015 net neutrality rules devastated sector investment -- despite the fact this is easily disproved by ISP earnings reports, SEC filings, and numerous CEO statements to investors
