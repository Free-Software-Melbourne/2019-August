## What is Mastodon?
<hr />

- Created by Eugen Rochko - [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=619786)
- Like Diaspora*/Twitter/PumpIO ... but with Toots and Boosts
- Federated micro blogging and social networking
- Many communities and servers cooperating

Note:
Twitter: the birdsite

---

## Why Mastodon?
<hr />

- Federation
- Privacy and Control
- Choice of communities and Moderation
- Add Free
- Open Source
- Design

Note:
Moderation: ratio of “everyone” to “people who can handle abuse reports” is much, much higher than on any centralized service

## Communities (Mastodon Servers)
<hr />

- @you and @you@there.io
- Filter by interest group, language, size, moderation and/or location
  - https://joinmastodon.org/
  - https://instances.social

---

## Reporting / Moderation
<hr />

- Moderation Rules
  - Restrictions on nudity, pornography, illegal content, spam and advertising
- Reporting
  - Initial report to your server, forwarded to remote if requested
  - Include description, links to users and posts
  - Disabling / Sandboxing / Deleting all occur at the local server level
- Migration to another instance (export, new account, import, link)

---

## Privacy
<hr />

- No arbitrary search
- Privacy settings on each post
  - Public
  - Unlisted (followers and your profile, no timelines)
  - Private (followers and mentions)
  - Direct (mentions only)
- Lock account (screen followers)
- Lists are private
- Block, Mute or Filter: Users and Servers
- Content Warnings: NSFW, Spoilers, jokes...

Note:
Design: Mastodon deliberately does not support arbitrary search... use hashtags for findability

---

## Drawbacks
<hr />

- Setup a server or use Other Peoples Computers
- Moderation can cut both ways
- Replies from blocked servers are visible only if you are following the user
- Multiple Personalities across the federation
