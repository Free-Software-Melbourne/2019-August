<hr />

## Spaces vs Tabs vs Open Source
- Using spaces instead of tabs is associated with higher salary
- Article: https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/
- Turns out that people who contribute to open source use spaces much more than people who don't
- People who use Git have higher salaries across all experience levels
- Interesting modeling issues with annual salary

## Bruce Perens Warns Grsecurity Breaches the GPL License
- "your company should avoid the Grsecurity product sold at grsecurity.net because it presents a contributory infringement and breach of contract risk"
- "However, grsecurity is only distributed to paid subscribers, and its use requires agreement to a grsecurity Access Agreement which voids access to future versions if the code is redistributed"
- "The thing is a joke, and they are clowns. When they started talking about people taking advantage of them, I stopped trying to be polite"
