### Upcoming Installfests

<hr />

##### LUV:
- Debian 9 launch party on Saturday 17th

##### Software Freedom Day?
- Thoughts?
- Comments?
- Volunteers?

Note:
Also LUV are having a Debian Launch Party on the 17th this Saturday so there might be an installfest happening there

So would this be something we could consider for SFD?
