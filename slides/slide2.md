### Linux Foundation Introduces 'Community Data License Agreements'
- you share source code. Why not share data?"
- Allows users to share data sets in the same way they share open source software code
- As systems require data to learn and evolve, no one organization can build, maintain and source all data required
- reflects the growing importance of information as a resource

### Friendlier GPL-Enforcement Permission?
- Proposed By Linux Kernel Developers
- Software Freedom Conservancy publicly applauded today the proposal of the Linux Kernel Enforcement Statement
- adopts the same termination provisions we are all familiar with from GPL-3.0 as an Additional Permission giving companies confidence that they will have time to come into compliance if a failure is identified
- offer violators a simple method to earn back the rights they had. Parties who violate the license have their rights restored provisionally as soon as they come back into compliance, and permanently if no copyright holders terminate those rights within sixty days of the last violation

### Fight For the Right To Repair Our Electronics
- The answer is now apparent: through right-to-repair legislation enacted at the state level
- The commercial vehicle industry was beaten in Massachusetts
- require manufacturers to provide access to service documentation, tools, firmware, and diagnostic programs

### Intel Management Engine ... this looks like a job for ... Google? ... or Purism?
- ME is actually running its own entire MINIX OS
- Due to its presence on every Intel system, the Unix-like OS is the most widely deployed OS in the world
- Google is working on removing it
- It's not even clear where the hardware is physically located anymore.
- but.. Purism Now Offers Laptops with Intel's 'Management Engine' Disabled
- because it runs coreboot and maintains its own BIOS firmware update process, it has been able to release coreboot that disables the Management Engine from running
- directly halting the ME CPU without the ability of recovery
- Disabling the Management Engine, long believed to be impossible, is now possible in all current Librem laptops
- It is also available as a software update for previously shipped recent Librem laptops... WOW!
