EW would probably be ideal however other venues have advantages too

Uni or Business would be good outreach

Homestyle was also a cute concept I came across

# Outreach

<hr />

- Pre Promoting
- Promoting at Event
- Collaborating with other groups

Note:
Outreach

Would we want materials for before the event or at the event?

What kinds of promotions materials would we prepare and share?

Could we run this in conjunction with LUV or CCHS or others?

Or in conjunction with schools or unis?

# Risks

<hr />

- Users PC
- User data
- Misunderstandings
- Complexity
- Liability Forms

Note:
Risks

What happens if we hoze someones PC?

What about data backups? Provide storage?

Is there a possibility of misunderstandings? (dual booting)

A problem may get too complex for us to solve

Liability forms are advised
