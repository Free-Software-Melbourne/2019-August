- Single OS
- Small selection (eg Trisquil/Debian/Ubuntu)

Note:
Hardware

Will people bring their own PCs? Could we offer monitors/mice/kb/net?

Could we partner with a PC recycler?

Could we have a cheap "buy you own device" with Pi's or Androids? Could partner with CCHS or similar for this

Could we just use virtual machines?

or the Windows Linux sub system?

Could we even try going cloud style? (sponsorship)

# Network

- Wired
- Wireless
- DIY
- Speed to download a distro

Note:
Network

Will we provide a network? Just Wifi or wired too? or just BYO?

Big distros could take a long time to download if we want anything goes
