### 'How I Coined the Term Open Source'
- There are a number of accounts of the coining of the term... this is mine (Christine Peterson - Foresight Institute)
- Those new to the term "free software" assume it is referring to the price. Oldtimers must then launch into an explanation...
- While not ideal, it struck me as good enough. I ran it by at least four others: Eric Drexler, Mark Miller, and Todd Anderson liked it, while a friend in marketing and public relations felt the term "open" had been overused and abused and believed we could do better
- Maddog mentioned "freely distributable" as an earlier term, and "cooperatively developed" as a newer term. Eric listed "free software," "open source," and "sourceware"

### DuckDuckGo CEO: 'Google and Facebook Are Watching Our Every Move Online. It's Time To Make Them Stop'
- What you may not realize, though, is 76 percent of websites now contain hidden Google trackers, and 24 percent have hidden Facebook trackers
- Congress and federal agencies need to take a fresh look at what can be done to curb these data monopolies. They first need to demand more algorithmic and privacy policy transparency, so people can truly understand the extent
- Need to legislate that people own their own data, enabling real opt-outs
- Restrict how data can be combined including being more aggressive at blocking acquisitions that further consolidate data
- Only then can informed consent be possible

### Yale Privacy Lab has collaborated with Exodus Privacy to detect and expose trackers with the help of the F-Droid app store
- Google does screen apps submitted to the Play store to filter out malware, but the process is still mostly automated and very quick -- too quick to detect Android malware before it's published, as we've seen
- Installing F-Droid isn't a silver bullet, but it's the first step in protecting yourself from malware

- All web-based features that will ship with Firefox in the future must be served on over a secure HTTPS connection
- This means that if Firefox will add support for a new standard/feature starting tomorrow, if that standard/feature carries out communications between the browser and an external server, those communications must be carried out via HTTPS or the standard/feature will not work in Firefox
- Existing standards/features, but Mozilla hopes all Firefox features "will be considered on a case-by-case basis," and will slowly move to secure contexts (HTTPS) exclusively in the future
