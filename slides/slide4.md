# Intros and Talks

<hr />

- What is OS
- Linux and GNU
- VM

- ...

Note:
Do we want prepared talks on particular beginner issues?

Would these be better as workshops or demos?

How far do we want to go?

What would we cover: what is, basics of, about virtualization, nuts and bolts?

# Demos and Workshops

<hr />

- Install
- Default Applications
- Post-Install Applications

Note:
Will we just be installing Linux and saying "job done" or will we have planned activities to do with your new Linux box?

What kinds of software do we want to suggest next?

# Apps & Themes

<hr />

- General
- High level (security / games)
- Low level (photo editing / hello world / ...)
- ...

Note:
Would we theme the event to a general concept, a particular app or even a specific exercise?

Games could be fun, but privacy or secure comms could be popular

Science or photo editing could be popular and different too

# Branding

<hr />

- FSM
- FSF
- FOSS
- Issue based

Note:
Local branding of course, but would we promote materials from FSF, FSC, other OS...?

# Materials

<hr />

- Flyers
- CDs
- VMs
- PC
- Tutorials

Note:
Would we want to prepare CDs and thumb-drives for installing, PCs ready to go, or tutorial materials?

Some of the talks and workshops could be pre-recorded or sourced videos?
