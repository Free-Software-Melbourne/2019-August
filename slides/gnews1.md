### Has Open Source Changed the World?
- Most software remains locked up within the four walls of enterprise firewalls is that it's too costly with too small of an ROI
- Such a perception is impossible to break without walking the open source path
- We are starting to see companies like Bloomberg and Capital One get involved in open source in ways they never would have considered
- The biggest win for open source since its inception is how it has changed the narrative of how innovation happens

- "I was impressed by the level of support Linux has for ancient hardware like this."

### Meltdown and Spectre
- impetus for making long-overdue changes to the core DNA of the semiconductor industry and how chip architectures are designed
- http://www.zdnet.com/article/why-intel-x86-must-die-our-cloud-centric-future-depends-on-open-source-chips-meltdown/
- Modern processors go to great lengths to preserve the abstraction that they are in-order scalar machines
- Examples of what happens when we reason about security in the context of that abstraction, and then encounter minor discrepancies between the abstraction and reality
- The lack of speculation in the ARM1176, Cortex-A7, and Cortex-A53 cores used in Raspberry Pi render us immune to attacks of the sort
