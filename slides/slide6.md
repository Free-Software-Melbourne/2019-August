# Priorities

<hr />

- New users
- Problem solving
- Free OS
- Specific install

Note:
Publicizing our priorities help people set expectations.



Will we be focusing on newbs, or people who bring a PC, or people who buy HW, or a specific OS?

# Venue

<hr />

- Central
- Homestyle
- Regional
- School or Uni
- Business

Note:
EW would probably be ideal however other venues have advantages too

Uni or Business would be good outreach

Homestyle was also a cute concept I came across

# Outreach

<hr />

- Pre Promoting
- Promoting at Event

Note:
Would we want materials for before the event or at the event?

What kinds of promotions materials would we prepare and share?

# Risks

<hr />

- Users PC
- User data
- Misunderstandings
- Complexity
- Liability Forms

Note:
What happens if we hoze someones PC?

What about data backups? Provide storage?

Is there a possibility of misunderstandings? (dual booting)

A problem may get too complex for us to solve

Liability forms are advised
